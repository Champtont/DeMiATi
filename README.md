Creating Photo Share App for friends and Family
When I moved to Spain, an unfortunate thing happened. I was deleted from Facebook for violating terms and services, despite the fact that I had not posted anything for quite awhile. I was using the service to keep in touch with my friends and family. Facebook did not stop there. They deleted my accounts on every platform that they own. My Instagram, and finally my WhatsApp. This disconnect was jarring and quite hurtful. If you are unaware, Facebook leaves no recourse for possible wrongful account terminations because we are not their customers. We are their product. I had just recently undertaken the path of becoming a full stack developer and thought...I will build my own site. I want to be able to share photos of my travels and adventures with people who want to hear from me. I want to hear from them. I will make it happen.
This App is not about politics, connecting to strangers, or gaining fans... The app is centered on basic, real, connection. The app is about keeping close bonds with the ones closest to you and being able to take them with you.
